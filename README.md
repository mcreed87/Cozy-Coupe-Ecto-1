## About the Project

This Ecto-1 Cozy Coupe was a Christmas present for my 1 year old son. He is obsessed with Ghostbusters and loves the theme song, the 80's cartoons, and most recently, the new Afterlife movie. Ghost was one of his first words, and any time he needs it the theme song calms him right down. His favorite characters are Stay Puft and Egon. Since seeing the new movie, he is also obsessed with the Mini Pufts, or as he calls them, "puffs". This is just the first in what I believe will be a long line of Ghostbusters projects for him.

The car features lights, the theme song from the 80's cartoon, and the siren from Ecto-1 in the original movie. There are 3 switches on the dash to control what is active. The electronics for the car runÂ off a rechargeable battery pack.

## Assembly

* Test all the wiring and electronics before installing them on the Ecto-1 to prevent any unnecessary paint scratches.
* Drill all the switch holes.
* Assemble and test fit the roof rack (before painting.)
* Bend the electrical conduit and do a test fit. (Use a heat gun or hair dryer to bend it to fit the contour of the car.)
* To prep for painting, scuff all smooth surfaces with high grit sandpaper and wash the parts clean to remove all dust and oils.
* Paint all parts in a well ventilated area. Several light coats are required, and make sure to let all parts dry before applying the next coat.
  * I found that the spray paint didn't work well for the body of the car and the door. I painted all of it again in 3 coats of acrylic paint to make sure it was durable. (Pro-Tip: Use a large brush.) Then I went over it all with 2 clear coats.
* After painting, run all the wires and install the roof rack.
* Test all the wiring and electronics.
* Add all of the decals.
* Enjoy!
